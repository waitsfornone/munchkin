For a battle we start out with an equipped player. I need to hold 2 hands, Armor, Head, Feet, Legs, with spots for cheat and hireling. (Level as well)

The player also has class and race slots and a backpack full of other items.

The player is setup and managed by the user, but the battle calculations are done automatically.

First step is for the player to enter the monster they are fighting. We will need the ability to add extra monsters to the fight.

Provide the calculated win/loss with power stats for each side.

Then we can either add a player or a card to help either side.

Player will simply ask for the power of the player.

Card will ask for the card name, and will pull from the database.

Lastly, will need a die roll process to help with running away. (enter roll amount)

Track treasure and level rewards, as well as provide instructions for the bad stuff once the battle is over. (have a key command for finishing the battle)


##### I should make sure that the game logic and the game display are in two separate files. And the game runs in a 3rd. This will allow for iteration later. See IntelliJ project.
